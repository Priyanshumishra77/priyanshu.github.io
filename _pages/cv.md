* Description:
  * The I2C bus uses two wires: serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). All I2C master and slave devices are connected with only those two wires. Each device can be a transmitter, a receiver, or both. Some devices are masters â€“ they generate bus clocks and initiate communication on the bus, other devices are slaves and respond to the commands on the bus. To communicate with a specific device, each slave device must have an address that is unique on the bus. I2C master devices (usually microcontrollers) donâ€™t need an address since no other (slave) device sends commands to the master.
